# Whisker Knight - by Yen Vo, Katie Cheng, and Thanh Ngo (UGA Hacks - Spring 2024)

### **Purpose**<br>
Whisker Knight is a superhero cat game where players can take control of a superhero cat and save the park from being overrun by slimes. The game will run infinitely, and the player will have a finite number of lives. It is up to the player to obtain as much points as they can to make it on the leaderboard.

### **Tools Utilized**<br>
Application: Android Studio, Gradle<br>
Programming Language: Java<br>
Graphics: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop<br>
Sound Effects / Audio Design: mp3<br>
Version Control: GitHub<br>

### **Problems and Solutions**<br>
- Problem One: Syncing the images with the Object class<br>
Solution: Researching about our problem and comparing it to others on the Internet has allowed us to understand our errors in greater detail. Eventually, once we figured out the root of the problem through strenuous debugging, we were able to swiftly correct the mistake and sync up the character alongside the images.<br>
- Problem Two: Bad Coding Principles<br>
Solution: We conducted a comprehensive review to identify repetitive mistakes and improved on the readability of the code as much as we can through the use of documentation and comments in our coding. By doing so, we do not overlap each other.

### **We did not use any APIs nor other public frameworks.**
